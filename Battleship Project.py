# Project: Battleship
#  Design:
#     - GUI is based on Python tkinter
#     - use winsound (on Windows) to play game sound wave files
#     - use os.system(afplay) (on Mac, not tested) to play game sound wave files
#     - sound playing is run a separate thread so that UI thread is not blocked
#     - timer thread to keep updating game time
#     - Two views:
#       * Main View UI: three panels(Greeting, Player skill selection, Buttons for Play, Exit, Sound On/Off)
#       * Game View UI: three panels(Game Board, Game Information, Buttons for Quit and Sound On/Off)
#     - Show and keep tracking of missiles available, missiles missed, ships sunken
#     - Update game board (internal data, and graphic presentation) as game is being played
#     - Use mouse to select target grid on the board, the grid coordinate where missile is aiming at is displayed
#     - Animate missile launch, and show the last animate frame based on it's a miss or hit
#     - Sound wave is played with animation, based on the launch is a miss, hit or last ditch to sink a ship
#     - Record game start time and end time to calculate the duration of game
#     - Missile is launched by mouse click, invalid mouse click is ignored
#     - toggle game_cheat flag by press 'S' key before play game to place a red dot in grid to indicate ship
#       for development debug purpose
